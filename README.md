# Bookstore-Inventory
Inventory management system for a bookstore.

I wrote this programme as the final project in my HyperionDev bootcamp after learning how SQL databases work and how to use them in python via Sqlite.

The programme accesses a database that stores attributes such as ID, Title, Author and Quantity in stock. The user can then view all entries in the database or search for book by title, author or ID. The user is also able to add new entries to the database or edit existing ones.
